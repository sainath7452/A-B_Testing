# Eniac's A/B Testing Analysis

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on improving the user experience on Eniac’s website by leveraging A/B testing techniques to boost conversions and increase iPhone 13 sales. The primary objective was to evaluate different versions of the "SHOP NOW" button and determine which design results in the highest click-through rate (CTR).

## **Technologies and Tools**
- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- Successfully conducted data collection, cleaning, and statistical analysis to evaluate button performance.
- Learned how to implement A/B testing methodologies and interpret results for decision-making.

---

## **Challenges Addressed**
The original "SHOP NOW" button design exhibited a low conversion rate of 2%. To address this, four button variations were tested:
1. **Option A:** A white "SHOP NOW" button.
2. **Option B:** A red "SHOP NOW" button.
3. **Option C:** A white "SEE DEALS" button.
4. **Option D:** A red "SEE DEALS" button.

---

## **Insights and Reflections**
- **Results:** The analysis revealed that Option C (white "SEE DEALS") achieved a significantly higher CTR compared to Options B (red "SHOP NOW") and D (red "SEE DEALS").
- **Considerations:** Both Options A and C performed well overall, making them strong candidates for implementation. However, further analysis using additional metrics and qualitative feedback would help solidify the final choice.
- **Key Learning:** This project demonstrated the value of a data-driven approach in optimizing user interface elements to improve customer engagement and increase sales.
